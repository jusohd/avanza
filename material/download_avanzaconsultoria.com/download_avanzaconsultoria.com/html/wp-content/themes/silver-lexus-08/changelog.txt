                -   Moved Navigation code to the header. - Added link to
                    shortcut icon (favicon) and javascript to allow drop
                    downs to function in IE5/6.

                -   Changed various font, headings, and anchor colours to
                    be slight darker.

                -   Set min-width of #nav to 1000px to combat navigation
                    jumping to next line if screen width is too narrow.

                -   Changed #navigation to display: block and removed
                    position: absolute as it isn't needed anymore.

****** Version 0.9d ******

1. style.css    Bug Fix
                -   Added workarounds for the display of Widgets. Should
                    display Widgets correctly now. Might act weird on the
                    odd Widget, but seems fine on the popular Widgets.

                -   Changed the .calendar class to #wp-calendar id to fix the display of
                    the Widget calendar.

                -   Added #submit to cursor: pointer; for the
                    comment submit button.

                -   Changed the padding on #column1 ul li and #column1 ol li to 0.2em.

                -   Changed #column1 ol/ul to show border-top and border-bottom on lists.

                -   Added hr style to display horizontal rules in Firefox. (Thanks Marek)

                -   Added background image to #nav li ul

****** Version 0.9e ******

1. style.css    Updated
                -   Moved Widget Styles to widgets.css. If person doesn't
                    have any Widgets installed, there's no point having them
                    in the style.css file.

2. widgets.css  New
                -   Moved Widget Styles from style.css.

3. header.php   Updated
                -   Added an if function_exists('dynamic_sidebar'). If the
                    dynamic_sidebar does exist, then load the widgets.css styles.

4. sidebar.php  Updated
                -   Added Adsense code. Default is commented out. Make sure you
                    update your google_ad_client.

5. functions.php Updated
                -   Added new function first_year which will display the year
                    of the first post, and the current year in the footer.php file.

6. footer.php   Updated
                -   Changed the copyright years to use function first_year().

****** Version 0.9f ******

1. functions.php Bug Fix
                -   Fixed up odd issue of first post's date being displayed
                    as '0' in function first_year().

****** Version 1.0a ******

                -   Fixed and added a bunch of styles to fix the liquid layout
                    problems in IE5/6

2. Too many changes!
